## basics

budō allows you to get your scripts up and running quickly in a local environment. 

First, you will need [NodeJS and npm](http://nodejs.org/download/). Then you can install the tools globally like so:

```sh
npm install budo watchify garnish -g
```

Later we will explore the benefits of saving these locally, but for now it's easier to get up and running if they are global. 

The next step is to create an index.js file and start serving it with budō:

```sh
cd my-cool-project
touch index.js
budo index.js --outfile bundle.js --verbose
```

Now if you open `localhost:9966` in your browser, it will serve you with the bundled output of `index.js`.

When you save `index.js`, the script will be re-built into the `bundle.js` output file. Watchify will also print the time elapsed into console.

## pretty-printing

Earlier we installed [garnish](https://github.com/mattdesl/garnish), which will give us a nicer output in terminal. We can use it like so:

```sh
budo index.js --outfile bundle.js | garnish
```

## index.html

Notice we haven't had to write any HTML! If you want to, though, you can drop `index.html` in the same folder that you are serving budō from (or `--dir` folder), and it will use that instead of a dynamically generated index.

## local installation

Although global install gets us up and running quickly, it's preferred to save these tools as `devDependencies` in your projects so that others cloning your repo are working with the same versions as you. To do that, you need a `package.json`, which you can create like so:

```sh
npm init
```

Then, you can save the tools locally: 

```sh
npm install budo watchify garnish --save-dev
```

You can't run local tools with a simple terminal command; instead, we need to use [npm-scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts). Open up your package.json and update `"scripts"` so it looks like this:

```sh
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "budo index.js -o bundle.js --live | garnish"
  },
```

Now users cloning your repo can run the following to start serving the file:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## temp directory

If you don't specify an `--outfile` or `-o` argument, budō will save a `bundle.js` to a temporary directory that gets destroyed upon closing the server. 

```sh
budo index.js --verbose | garnish
```

You can also change the mapping like so, which allows you to specify a different entry point in your `index.html`:

```sh
budo index.js:static.js | garnish
```

This is good for quick prototyping, but the `--outfile` approach is more robust and cross-platform, and thus preferred when delivering budō as a local dependency.

## live reload

budō also includes support for [LiveReload](livereload.com). The `--live` argument injects a script tag into your HTML file so you can reload across many devices and browsers.

```sh
budo index.js --outfile bundle.js --live | garnish
```

Now when you save the `index.js` file, it will trigger a live-reload event on your `localhost:9966` tab after watchify has finished bundling. It also listens to HTML and CSS reload, and injects stylesheets without a page refresh. 

Alternatively, you can use `--live-plugin` if you want to enable LiveReload through the browser extension (e.g. [for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en)). In this case, no script is injected into the HTML, and you need to [enable LiveReload manually](https://github.com/mattdesl/wtch#setup).

## caching

For the best experience, make sure that browser caching is disabled during development. Otherwise you might accidentally get served the empty source file mid-bundle, and subsequent reloads will do nothing. In Chrome you can disable it by hitting the Gears button in the DevTools, and checking `Disable Cache (while DevTools is open)`
